			<h2>Government and Political Conditions in the Philippines</h2>
			<p>
				The Philippines has a representative democracy modeled on the U.S.
				system. The 1987 constitution, adopted during the Aquino
				administration, reestablished a presidential system of government with
				a bicameral legislature and an independent judiciary. The president is
				limited to one 6-year term. Provision also was made in the
				constitution for autonomous regions in Muslim areas of Mindanao and in
				the Cordillera region of northern Luzon where many indigenous tribes
				still live.

				The 24-member Philippine Senate is elected at large. There are
				currently 22 senators; one vacancy is due to the 2002 resignation of
				the late Blas Ople to become Foreign Secretary and the other to the
				death of an incumbent senator. The May 2004 national election produced
				12 new senators, although, because current Senator Noli De Castro was
				elected Vice President, he will leave his seat empty and the new
				Senate will be comprised of 23 senators. Of a maximum 250 members of
				the House of Representatives, 207 are elected from single-member
				districts. The remainder of the House seats are designated for
				sectoral party representatives elected at large; currently there are
				19 such representatives in the House. The new Congressional term is
				scheduled to begin in July, 2004. In addition to the 207 district
				representatives, there will be an additional 24 sectoral party
				representatives.
