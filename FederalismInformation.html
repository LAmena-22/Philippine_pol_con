				The terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the
				Latin word foedus, meaning "treaty, pact or covenant." Their common
				meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or
				inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a
				treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms. It was in this sense
				that James Madison in Federalist 39 had referred to the new US
				Constitution as 'neither a national nor a federal Constitution, but a
				composition of both' (i.e. neither constituting a single large unitary
				state nor a league/confederation among several small states, but a
				hybrid of the two). In the course of the nineteenth century the
				meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer
				uniquely to the novel compound political form established, while the
				meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states. Thus,
				this article relates to the modern usage of the word 'federalism'.

			Modern federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and
			institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and
			provincial/state governments. The term federalist describes several
			political beliefs around the world depending on context.
		</p>
		<p>
			Federalism is sometimes viewed as in the context of international
			negotiation as "the best system for integrating diverse nations, ethnic
			groups, or combatant parties, all of whom may have cause to fear control
			by an overly powerful center." However, in some countries, those
			skeptical of federal prescriptions believe that increased regional
			autonomy is likely to lead to secession or dissolution of the nation. In
			Syria, federalization proposals have failed in part because "Syrians
			fear that these borders could turn out to be the same as the ones that
			the fighting parties have currently carved out."

			Federations such as Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia collapsed as soon as it
			was possible to put the model to the test.

		<h2>Explanations for adoption of federalist systems</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				According to Daniel Ziblatt's Structuring the State, there are four
				competing theoretical explanations in the academic literature for the
				adoption of federal systems:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Ideational theories, which hold that a greater degree of ideological
					commitment to decentralist ideas in society makes federalism more
					likely to be adopted.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cultural-historical theories, which hold that federal institutions
					are more likely to be adopted in societies with culturally or
					ethnically fragmented populations.
				</li>
				<li>
					"Social contract" theories, which hold that federalism emerges as a
					bargain between a center and a periphery where the center is not
					powerful enough to dominate the periphery and the periphery is not
					powerful enough to secede from the center.
				</li>
				<li>
					"Infrastructural power" theories, which hold that federalism is
					likely to emerge when the subunits of a potential federation already
					have highly developed infrastructures (e.g. they are already
					constitutional, parliamentary, and administratively modernized
					states).
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Immanuel Kant was an advocate of federalism, noting that "the problem
				of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils" so
				long as they possess an appropriate constitution which pits opposing
				factions against each other with a system of checks and balances. In
				particular individual states required a federation as a safeguard
				against the possibility of war.
